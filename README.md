# Pneumonia Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This repository contains code for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN architecture is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images labeled with pneumonia or normal.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. It contains a total of X-ray images with labels indicating whether the patient has pneumonia or not.
